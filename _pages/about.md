I am a first year Ph.D student at University of Surrey under the supervision of Prof. Tao Xiang and Prof. Yi-Zhe Song.

Prior to joining University of Surrey, I was an AI Researcher at WeBank under the lead of Dr. Lixin Fan and I was a lab member of CISIP in [University of Malaya (UM)](https://um.edu.my/) under [Prof. Chan Chee Seng](http://cs-chan.com/).
