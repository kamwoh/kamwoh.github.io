I am an AI Research Scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/) London, where I work on video diffusion models and generative rendering.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Surrey, supervised by Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html) and Prof. [Yi-Zhe Song](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/yi-zhe-song), and worked closely with Dr. [Xiatian (Eddy) Zhu](https://xiatian-zhu.github.io/).

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) at the [University of Malaya (UM)](https://um.edu.my/), where I was a lab member of CISIP under Prof. [Chan Chee Seng](http://cs-chan.com/).

You can contact me via *kamwoh \[at\] gmail.com*. Please see my CV at [here](https://kamwoh.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

My Projects
======

### Generative Rendering

1. [Kaleido](https://shikun.io/projects/kaleido) - A family of spatial generative models that achieves photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering.

### Diffusion Models

1. [PartCraft (ECCV 2024)](https://github.com/kamwoh/partcraft) - Crafting object by parts with text-to-image diffusion models.
2. [Chirpy3D](https://github.com/kamwoh/chirpy3d) - Learning 3D fine-grained object generation from 2D unposed images.

### Interpretable Fine-grained Hashing

1. [ConceptHash (CVPRW 2024 FGVC11 Best paper award)](https://github.com/kamwoh/concepthash) - Learning to encode parts into interpretable codes.

### Deep Hashing for Image Retrieval

1. [DPN (IJCAI 2020)](https://github.com/kamwoh/DPN) - Bit-wise hinge loss with random orthogonal codebook.
2. [OrthoHash (NeurIPS 2021)](https://github.com/kamwoh/orthohash) - Cross entropy loss with random orthogonal codebook.
3. [FIRe](https://github.com/CISiPLab/cisip-FIRe) - Open source Fast Image Retrieval framework.
4. [SDC (BMVC 2023 Oral)](https://github.com/kamwoh/sdc) - Unsupervised hashing by maximizing the utilization of hash spaces through Wasserstein distance.

### Deep Watermarking

1. [DeepIPR (NeurIPS 2019)](https://github.com/kamwoh/DeepIPR) - Watermarking our DNNs by embedding "passport" and "signature".
2. [IPR-GAN (CVPR 2022)](https://github.com/dingsheng-ong/ipr-gan) - Protecting our GANs by generating watermarked images.
