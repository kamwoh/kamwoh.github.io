Welcome to my personal page
======
I am currently working at WeBank, Shenzhen, as an AI Researcher, supervised by [Dr. Lixin Fan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lixin-fan-9278406/). My research interests are deep learning, computer vision and representation learning.

Prior to joining WeBank, I was a lab member of CISIP in [University of Malaya (UM)](https://um.edu.my/) under [Prof. Chan Chee Seng](http://cs-chan.com/).

You can contact me via *kamwoh \[at\] gmail.com*.
