I am a third year Ph.D student at University of Surrey under the supervision of Prof. [Tao Xiang](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/T.Xiang/index.html) and Prof. [Yi-Zhe Song](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/yi-zhe-song). I also work closely with Dr. [Xiatian (Eddy) Zhu](https://xiatian-zhu.github.io/).

Prior to joining University of Surrey, I was an AI Researcher at WeBank under the lead of Dr. [Lixin Fan](https://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=fOsgdn0AAAAJ&hl=en) and I was a lab member of CISIP in [University of Malaya (UM)](https://um.edu.my/) under Prof.  [Chan Chee Seng](http://cs-chan.com/).

You can contact me via *kamwoh \[at\] gmail.com*.
